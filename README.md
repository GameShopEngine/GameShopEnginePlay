# GameShop Engine Play

Hi

I am making a FOSS License.  Anyone can Freely Use this software.  Anyone who uses this Software cannot Publish Derivative Works without Purchasing the Play listed on Google Play.
I want people who use this to Purchase the Play listed on Google Play as soon as development on your Video Game or Play is Started.  That is saying instantly.  The Play will likely cost $10 to $50.  That is
extremely cheap.  Anyone who uses this will be able to create an Play or a Game.  Thats Millions of Dollars of Profit.  Please purchase the Play called GameShop Engine on Google Play to help out. 
Right now there is not an App Listing.  That will change within 2 Months.  Within 2 Months I intend to Publish to the Google Play Store.  I am making this available so people will know enough about it
to pay.

Thank You and Have A Nice Day
